# spectral-unmixing
code and files for MSOT spectral unmixing

## project description
test and implement data analytics methods that quantitatively measure the relative concentrations of oxyhemoglobin, deoxyhemoglobin and exogenous dyes more accurately and more precisely than with traditional spectral unmixing.  Machine learning methods have been applied to improve quantitative measurements from CEST MRI spectra acquired in our research program, and spectra from CEST MRI and MSOT have similar characteristics, indicating that analyzing MSOT spectra can be accomplished using similar machine learning methods.
