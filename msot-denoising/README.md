# msot-denoising
code and files for MSOT spectral unmixing

## project description
Develop data analytics methods for denoising MSOT images and spectra, which can lead to improved data quality for measuring the relative concentrations of oxyhemoglobin, deoxyhemoglobin and exogenous dyes.  Deep learning methods have been applied to denoise images from MRI studies, indicating that denoising MSOT images can be accomplished using similar deep learning methods.
