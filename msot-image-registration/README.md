# msot-image-registration
code and files for MSOT image registration

## project description
Address motion artifacts during MSOT imaging by developing data analytics methods that improve image registration of a series of images acquired over time, which can improve our measurements of vascular  perfusion with exogenous dyes. Deep learning methods have been applied to improve the registrations of a series of astronomy images (which have bright stars in a dark sky that are similar to bright hemoglobin-filled blood vessels in the dark background in MSOT images), indicating  that registering MSOT images can be accomplished using similar deep learning methods.
